# GitHub Setup - Quick Guide

## Create Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com
2. Click **"+"** (top right) → **"New repository"**
3. Name: `watercooler`
4. Make it **Private** ✅
5. **Don't** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## After Creating

You'll see a page with setup instructions. **Don't follow those!**

Instead, just copy the repository URL. It looks like:
- `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/watercooler.git`

**Paste that URL here and I'll connect everything!**
