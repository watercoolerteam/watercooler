# Alternative Ways to Find Your Supabase Connection String

## Option 1: Look for "Connection Info" or "Connection Pooling"
- In Settings > Database, look for:
  - "Connection info"
  - "Connection pooling" 
  - "Connection parameters"
  - "Database URL"

## Option 2: Look in Project Settings
- Click on your project name at the top
- Look for "Database" or "Connection" settings
- Sometimes it's under "API" settings

## Option 3: We Can Build It Manually
If you can find these details, I can help you build the connection string:
- Your project reference (looks like: `abcdefghijklmnop`)
- Your database password (the one you created when setting up the project)
- Your region (like `us-east-1` or `eu-west-1`)

## Option 4: Check the SQL Editor
- Sometimes the connection info is shown in the SQL Editor
- Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- Look for connection details there

Let me know what you see in the Database settings, and I'll help you find it!
