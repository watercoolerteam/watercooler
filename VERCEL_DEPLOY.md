# Deploy to Vercel - Simple Steps

## Option 1: Deploy Directly from Your Computer (Easiest!)

You can deploy without GitHub using Vercel CLI:

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (I'll do this for you)
2. **Login to Vercel** (opens browser)
3. **Deploy** (one command!)

## Option 2: Use GitHub (If you prefer)

1. Create the repository on GitHub first
2. Then push code
3. Connect to Vercel

**Which do you prefer?** I recommend Option 1 - it's faster and easier!
