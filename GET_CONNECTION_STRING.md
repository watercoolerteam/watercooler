# How to Get Your Supabase Connection String

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **In your Supabase project dashboard**, look at the left sidebar
2. Click on the **Settings icon** (⚙️ gear icon) at the bottom
3. Click on **"Database"** in the settings menu
4. Scroll down to find **"Connection string"** section
5. You'll see different connection modes - look for the one that says **"URI"**
6. You'll see a connection string that looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.xxxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   ```
7. **Click the "Copy" button** next to it (or select and copy the text)
8. **IMPORTANT**: The connection string will have `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` in it - you need to replace this with the actual database password you created when setting up the project

## What to do next:

Once you have the connection string (with your password filled in), I'll help you:
- Create the .env file
- Set up all the database tables
- Get everything working!

Just paste the connection string here (or tell me when you have it ready).
