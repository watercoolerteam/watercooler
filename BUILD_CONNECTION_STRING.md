# Building Your Connection String

I have your project reference: **jjgvsmuvkbhfkwcesrcw**

## What I Need:
Your database password (the one you created when setting up the Supabase project)

## If You Don't Remember It:
1. Go back to Settings > Database
2. Click "Reset database password"
3. Create a new password and save it somewhere safe

## Once I Have Your Password:
I'll create the connection string in this format:
```
postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.jjgvsmuvkbhfkwcesrcw.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

Then I'll:
1. Create the .env file with your connection string
2. Set up all the database tables
3. Get everything working!
