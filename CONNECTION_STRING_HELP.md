# I Found Your Project Reference!

From your screenshot, I can see your project reference is: **jjgvsmuvkbhfkwcesrcw**

## Next Steps:

1. **Check the Database section:**
   - In the left sidebar, under "CONFIGURATION", click on **"Database"** (it has an arrow pointing right)
   - Look for "Connection string" or "Connection info" there

2. **Or we can build it manually:**
   - I have your project reference: `jjgvsmuvkbhfkwcesrcw`
   - I just need your **database password** (the one you created when setting up the project)
   - If you forgot it, you can reset it using the "Reset database password" button we saw earlier

## The Connection String Format:
Once I have your password, it will be:
```
postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.jjgvsmuvkbhfkwcesrcw.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Try clicking on "Database" in the Configuration section first** - the connection string might be there!
