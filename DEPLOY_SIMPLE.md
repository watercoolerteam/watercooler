# 🚀 Deploy to Vercel - Super Simple!

## What I'll Do For You

I'll run the deployment command. It will:
1. Open your browser
2. Ask you to login to Vercel (or create account)
3. Ask a few questions (I'll tell you what to answer)
4. Deploy your site!

## The Questions You'll See

When Vercel asks:

1. **"Set up and deploy?"** → Type: **Y** (Yes)
2. **"Which scope?"** → Press **Enter** (use your account)
3. **"Link to existing project?"** → Type: **N** (No - it's new)
4. **"What's your project's name?"** → Press **Enter** (uses "watercooler")
5. **"In which directory is your code located?"** → Press **Enter** (uses current directory)

Then it will ask about environment variables - **I'll help you add those!**

## Ready?

Just say "go" and I'll start the deployment!
