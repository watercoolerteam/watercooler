# 🎨 Adding the Watercooler Logo

## Step 1: Add Logo Image

1. **Save your logo image** as `logo.png` or `logo.svg`
   - PNG: Better for pixel art logos (like yours)
   - SVG: Better for scalable vector graphics

2. **Place it in the `public` folder:**
   ```
   public/logo.png
   ```

3. **Recommended sizes:**
   - For PNG: 64x64px or 128x128px (will be displayed at 32x32px)
   - For SVG: Any size (scales automatically)

## Step 2: Test It

After adding the logo:
1. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Check the header on all pages
3. Make sure it looks good on mobile too

## Step 3: Adjust if Needed

If the logo doesn't look right, we can adjust:
- Size (height/width)
- Spacing between logo and text
- Alignment
- Mobile responsiveness

Let me know if you need any adjustments!
