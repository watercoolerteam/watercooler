### If you don't have GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com and create a free account
2. Create a new repository (click the "+" icon → "New repository")
3. Name it: `watercooler`
4. Make it **Private** (recommended)
5. Don't initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

### Push Your Code:

I'll help you do this! Just tell me:
- Do you have a GitHub account? (Yes/No)
- If yes, what's your GitHub username?

2. Sign up/Login (use "Continue with GitHub")
3. Click **"Add New Project"**
4. Import your `watercooler` repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js ✅

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables

1. Click **"Environment Variables"** section
2. Add each one (I'll give you the exact values)

## Step 4: Deploy!
