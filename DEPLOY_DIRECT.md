# Deploy Directly to Vercel (No GitHub Push Needed!)

Since we need authentication to push to GitHub, let's deploy directly using Vercel CLI.

## What Will Happen

1. I'll run a command
2. Your browser will open
3. You'll login to Vercel
4. It will ask a few questions
5. Your site deploys!

## The Questions

When it asks:

1. **"Set up and deploy?"** → Type: **Y**
2. **"Which scope?"** → Press **Enter**
3. **"Link to existing project?"** → Type: **N**
4. **"What's your project's name?"** → Press **Enter** (uses "watercooler")
5. **"In which directory is your code located?"** → Press **Enter**

Then it will deploy! After that, we'll add the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

**Ready?** Say "deploy" and I'll start!
